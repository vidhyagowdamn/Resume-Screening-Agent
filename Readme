My agent is a Resume Screening Agent that evaluates how well a candidate’s resume matches a given job description and produces a structured, human-readable report. It is designed to support recruiters, HR teams, and hiring managers in shortlisting candidates faster and more objectively.

What the agent does

Takes a PDF resume and a job description as input.

Extracts and cleans the resume text, then compares it against the job description.

Generates:

A match score (0–100)

A short alignment summary

Key strengths of the candidate relative to the JD

Gaps or risks (missing skills, experience, or requirements)

A final recommendation: “Strong Fit”, “Possible Fit”, or “Not a Fit” based on the scoring scale:

85–100: Strong Fit

70–84: Possible Fit

Below 70: Not a Fit




Features

Focuses on skills & tools match, experience relevance, seniority level, education/certifications (when important in the JD), and additional requirements (location, work authorization, language, time zone, etc.).

Handles multiple resumes and returns results in a standardized JSON structure, making it easy to integrate into other systems.

Clear explanation of why a candidate scored high/low via strengths and gaps lists, not just a black-box score.


Limitations

Performance depends on the quality of the input resume (poorly formatted PDFs or images may reduce accuracy).

Currently optimized for text-based, English resumes and JDs.

It does not make final hiring decisions; it is meant as a decision-support tool, not a replacement for human review.


Tools, APIs & models used

Backend: Python + Flask to build the API server, define routes, receive uploaded resumes, and return JSON responses.

Frontend: React for the UI where users upload PDF resumes, enter/paste the job description, and view results.

NLP pipeline:

pdf_reader.py – extracts raw text from uploaded PDF resumes.

text_cleaner.py – cleans and normalizes text (removing noise, fixing spacing, etc.).

resume_ranker.py – compares resume text to the job description, calculates the match score, identifies strengths/gaps, and produces the final recommendation.


The frontend calls the Flask backend via JSON APIs, and the results are displayed in a React component (e.g., Results.js).


Setup / how to run

1. Backend (Flask)

Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt.

Run the Flask server (e.g., python app.py). This starts the API that accepts PDF uploads and returns evaluation results as JSON.



2. Frontend (React)

Install Node dependencies (npm install or yarn).

Start the React app (npm start / yarn start).

The frontend allows users to upload resumes, submit the job description, and calls the Flask API to show the score, summary, strengths and gaps.



3. The system can be deployed with the backend and frontend hosted together, and a separate Gradio/Streamlit-style demo can be added on top if required for quick evaluation.
