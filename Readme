Resume Screening Agent — Project Description

This project implements an AI-powered Resume Screening Agent that evaluates how well a candidate’s resume matches a given job description. The system generates:

A numeric match score (0–100)

A brief alignment summary

Key strengths of the candidate

Gaps or risks relative to the job

A final recommendation: “Strong fit,” “Possible fit,” or “Not a fit.”


The evaluation process is based on weighted criteria, prioritized as follows:

1. Skills & Tools Match — Required and nice-to-have technologies.


2. Experience Relevance — Similar roles, responsibilities, domain, and impact.


3. Seniority Level Fit — Years of experience, project complexity, leadership.


4. Education & Certifications — Highlighted only if important to the JD.


5. Additional Requirements — Location, work authorization, language, time zone, etc.



The scoring follows a defined scale:

85–100: Strong fit

70–84: Possible fit

Below 70: Not a fit
