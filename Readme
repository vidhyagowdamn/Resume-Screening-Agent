📄 Resume Screening Agent 

1. Overview
This project is an AI-powered Resume Screening Agent that evaluates how well a candidate’s resume matches a given job description. It produces a structured, human-readable report to help recruiters and hiring teams shortlist candidates faster and more objectively.
The agent analyzes resumes on multiple dimensions such as skills match, experience relevance, seniority level, and specific requirements mentioned in the job description.


2. Features
✅ Core Capabilities
Accepts a PDF resume + Job Description (JD) as input
Extracts, cleans, and normalizes resume text
Compares resume content with the JD using an NLP matching pipeline

Generates:
Match Score (0–100)
Alignment Summary
Key Strengths
Missing Skills / Gaps

Final Recommendation
85–100: Strong Fit
70–84: Possible Fit
Below 70: Not a Fit



🔧 Additional Features
Supports multiple resume inputs
Produces results in a standardized JSON structure
Clear explanations for why a candidate scored high/low
Easy to integrate with ATS systems or HR workflows


3. Limitations
Accuracy depends on the quality of the resume input (poor PDFs may reduce extraction quality)
Optimized for English resumes and job descriptions
Does not act as a hiring decision-maker; it is a decision-support tool


4. Tech Stack & APIs Used
🧠 AI & NLP
Custom Python NLP pipeline
Modules used:
pdf_reader.py — PDF text extraction
text_cleaner.py — text preprocessing & normalization
resume_ranker.py — scoring, strengths, gaps, and final recommendation


🖥 Backend
Python + Flask
Defines API routes
Handles PDF uploads
Returns evaluation JSON responses



🌐 Frontend
React JS
UI to upload resumes

Displays match score, summary, strengths, and gaps


5. Setup & Run Instructions
🏗 Backend (Flask API)
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Start the Flask server:
python app.py
3. Server will run (e.g., http://localhost:5000) and accept PDF + JD inputs as JSON.

🎨 Frontend (React)
1. Install dependencies:
npm install
2. Run the React application:
npm start
3. The frontend will communicate with the Flask backend and display the results.


6. Deployment
The backend and frontend can be deployed together on platforms such as:
Render
Vercel
Netlify + Flask API
Railway
AWS / GCP / Azure


Below are step-by-step installation instructions (Backend + Frontend + optional components)  use for deployment.

Installation — Step-by-step
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ installed
Node.js 16+ and npm (or yarn)
Git

Backend (Flask API)
1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>/backend


2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
python -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Configure environment variables
Create a .env file (or use your preferred secrets manager) with entries such as:
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_APP=app.py
PORT=5000
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
VECTOR_DB_API_KEY=...

5. Run database migrations / setup (if applicable)
Example for a simple SQLite or Postgres setup:
# If using Flask-Migrate
flask db upgrade


6. Start the Flask server
python app.py
The API should be reachable at http://localhost:5000 (or the port you configured).


7. Test the /evaluate endpoint with curl (example)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/evaluate" \
  -F "resume=@/path/to/resume.pdf" \
  -F "job_description=@/path/to/jd.txt

Frontend (React)
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder
cd ../frontend

2. Install Node dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

3. Configure API endpoint
Update .env or constants in the frontend with the backend base URL, e.g.:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000


4. Start the React development server
npm start
# or
yarn start
The UI should open at http://localhost:3000.

5. Use the UI to upload a resume and paste a job description, then submit to see results.
